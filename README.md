# Energy-Data-forecasting-using-statistical-methods-and-Machine-Learning-on-Python-
The first and foremost aim of this project is to improve the accuracy of energy forecasting by using different modelling techniques for our SMART meter dataset.
Secondly, to evaluate the suitability of simple traditional forecasting models and modern/ complex approaches in the context of our dataset. 
This project provides in depth literature review in terms of energy and timeseries data, machine learning and neural network models associate with respect to timeseries data.
It also provides in depth understanding of SMART meter dataset and its components using different visualizations supporting and answering certain research questions on the dataset. 
This study also helps in understanding the entire process involved in time series data analysis and forecasting. Starting from feature understanding and selection, statistical analysis involved, model selection using the statistical inferencing, evaluation of models tested and forecasting results and comparing the error, thereby concluding the right model for the dataset.
